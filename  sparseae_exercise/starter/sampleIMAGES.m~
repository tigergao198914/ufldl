%% ---------- YOUR CODE HERE --------------------------------------
%  Instructions: Fill in the variable called "patches" using data 
%  from IMAGES.  
%  
%  IMAGES is a 3D array containing 10 images
%  For instance, IMAGES(:,:,6) is a 512x512 array containing the 6th image,
%  and you can type "imagesc(IMAGES(:,:,6)), colormap gray;" to visualize
%  it. (The contrast on these images look a bit off because they have
%  been preprocessed using using "whitening."  See the lecture notes for
%  more details.) As a second example, IMAGES(21:30,21:30,1) is an image
%  patch corresponding to the pixels in the block (21,21) to (30,30) of
%  Image 1
for i = 1:10000
   imageIndex = randi([1 6]);
   startIndex1 = randi([1 504]);
   startIndex2 = randi([1 504]);
   patches(:,i) = reshape( IMAGES(startIndex1:startIndex1+,startIndex2:30,imageIndex), [8*8,1] );
